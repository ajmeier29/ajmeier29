## About Me

I'm a passionate developer of 15 years. I started my career in the backend and then fell in love with the front end. I enjoy building websites to help enrich people's lives. I also like to network and interface with new people on GitHub, X, and LinkeIn to help others learn something, while also learning myself! 

Follow my GitHub page for updates on some of my notes and other repos! I like to take notes here to share them with others!

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on 
- Building a <a href="https://github.com/ajmeier29/legionofwholeness">blog website</a> for a friend. Front end is Next.js/TailwindCSS and backend is in Node.js/Wordpress
- Building out a repo of TailwindCSS notes and compoenets. Found <a href="https://github.com/ajmeier29/tailwindComponents">here.</a>
- Building out a repo of notes for web design to help others find ideas or learn.
